# Create Solana App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Once you've clone the repo, create an `env.local` file in the root directory. Look at `.env.example` for the required variables.
Check [Datahub](https://datahub.figment.io/) for the RPC node URL and API key

```
yarn
yarn start
```

## Pathway outline

1. create acccount 1
2. request airdrop to fund account 1
3. query for starting balance of account 1
4. create account 2 to send funds to
5. transfer tokens from account 1 to account 2
6. query for ending balance of account 1 and account 2 to see change after transfer
